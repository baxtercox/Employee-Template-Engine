# Employee-Template-Engine

This application uses a Node CLI that takes in summeraries for each person. I used multiple
javascript pages to render an html page, store user data and other functions.
When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
